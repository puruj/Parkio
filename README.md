# Parkio
This is a project I did in second year of university in a group of 4. This a web application written in HTML, and Java. This
applcation aid citizens of New York City to find free parking spot locations. This applications uses the Google Maps API to display
visual markings of parking locations. They markings give information of how long one can park there and if someone is already parked
at a location. This is a all connected to a server so when a user parks at a location they can reserve the parking spot for themsheleves. 
So, now other users of the application can see the parking spot is taken.
